#whale project source code
These are code for the right whale project on kaggle, the frame work is inspired by the [lasagne tutorial](http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/tutorial.html). 
I'm more than happy if these code helped you a little. But if you are using it for you course project, please cite it correctly.
